                 Hello Campusers. Welcome back to our page. It's always a pleasure for us to hear from students doing amazing things - even when they don’t sound so sexy or exciting for so many people. The other day I was riding down the road to Kicukiro, and I met a student from ALU who is championing an online booking platform called Bongalo. Bongalo connects short term travellers from all over the world to affordable and comfortable accommodation across African cities. The venture is currently operational in Rwanda and Cameroon, turning over a decent revenue. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  Isn't it  so inspiring that such things could be achieved by your fellow students even before they graduate? Shouts out to  Minuifuong and his team.  These are the stories that inspired us to set up Campus VC. 
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  Anyway, that was just a side note. Back to today’s episode. One of the questions I get asked a lot by students is this, why should I purchase a ticket to enter the Campus VC competition? To be honest, this question bothers me a lot. Not only does it negate the fundamental principles of entrepreneurship, it reveals a degrading syndrome that many African students have incubated for so many years. Most students are used to free benefits hence never see the importance of taking investment leaps of faith. If you are such a student, we are sad to say that you are not exactly what Campus VC is looking for. We are looking for students who are passionate enough about change that they are willing to invest their resources and sweat to bring their ideas to life.

                </p>
                <p>

                  Our investment team is looking for studentpreneurs with a risk appetite, who are willing to invest their monies into their wildest dreams even when there is a chance of failure. Anyone else outside this bracket is just not our type. If you can’t take the first step to invest just RWF 10,000 into the journey, why should we trust you with our RWF 500,000? It's not gonna happen.  

                </p>

                <h3> We want you to take the first step.</h3>
                <p>

                  We’ve gone through the journey ourselves. We can tell you for a fact that anyone who is not willing to bet on their own future is not worthy of an investment. Campus VC is backed by students like you, who have gone through the process of fundraising and building businesses from ground-up. Our founders have collectively raised over RWF 80 million to invest in different business ventures. And guess what? They did this in their second and third years of university. Yet from all of them there is a common story. It all started with them investing the little they could afford in the beginning towards their entrepreneurial journey before investors could find confidence in them. That’s how our world works. 

                </p>

                <p>

                  The reason we ask you to purchase a ticket is because we want you to prove to us your commitment  to your own journey. An important quality of any entrepreneur is the ability and willingness to fundraise and take calculated risks. We ask studentpreneurs to demonstrate this quality by sourcing RWF 10,000 and purchasing a pitching ticket to qualify for entry into the monthly Campus VC competitions. If you are confident enough in yourself to bet on your future, so shall we. If you aren't, then don't expect us to. That’s our mantra.   

                </p>
                <img src="post.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">

                <h3> Here is why you should join the Campus VC competition.</h3>
                <p>

               Before I close off today’s episode, let's talk a bit more about the benefits you should expect to get from joining the Campus VC monthly competitions. Most of you are already familiar with the RWF 500,000 we provide to the winners of the monthly editions. While this is not the only benefit, it's a critical aspect of what we do. We have noticed that most student entrepreneurs are over-mentored and under-funded. We have designed our model to become part of a solution that makes pre-seed funding accessible to studentpreneurs in addition to other forms of in-kind support. When you join the competition and emerge the winner, expect to receive RWF 500,000 in your bank account within 5 business days. At this time, we do not take any equity from your business or idea. You continue to own 100% of it. We only require that you open a business account to facilitate this transaction.  

             </p>
             <p>
                The second benefit you should expect from us, and probably the most important one is follow-on support. This includes but not limited to follow-on funding for investment-ready studentpreneurs, business coaching and mentorship. Our experience tells us that it takes 10 years on average to build a successful company. Many studentpreneurs are not prepared to go through this journey. We work with winners of the monthly editions to provide bespoke incubation support towards getting them investment ready. When they are finally ready, we link them up with our partner investors who take it from there. Our lifelong commitment is to prepare studentpreneurs for the world of job creation pre and post graduation. We are building a team of accomplished entrepreneurs who will be dedicated to mentoring and coaching selected studentpreneurs throughout the business building process. Our support is not generic, but tailored to the needs of your business and team. 

             </p>
             <p>

               One might also wonder, what happens if I don't win? Well, we have limited funding every month so we are not able to fund all teams that go through the competition except for one winner. However, that does not mean that you will not get any form of support if you don't emerge a winner. All participants of the competition will receive certificates of participation recognizing their involvement with our process. In addition to that, your idea or business will be featured on our monthly investor packet which is shared to all our angel investor networks. We believe that this will raise your chances of meeting the right investor. We also facilitate warm introductions between studentpreneurs and interested investors whenever the need calls for it - at no additional cost to a student.
